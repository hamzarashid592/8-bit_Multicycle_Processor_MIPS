# 8-bit_Multicycle_Processor_MIPS
This is a basic architecture of the **Multicycle MIPS Processor** written in Verilog. Each component of the processor has been built as a separate module. All of these modules have been integrated to a single datapath in the **Datapath.v** file. 

I have also included the test benches in this repository. They are named after the name of the module having a **test** suffix.
